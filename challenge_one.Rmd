## Step 1
Load the data IMDB-movies as a tibble named d.

```
{r}
f <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ada-2024-datasets/main/IMDB-movies.csv"
d <- read_csv (f, col_names=TRUE)
```

## Step 2
Filter dataset to include just movies from 1920-1979 and movies that are between 1-3 hours long. 
Add a new column that codes the startYear into a new variable, decade. There may have been a way to filter by both in one filter function, but I could not work it out, so it stayed separate.

```
{r}
d <- d |>
  filter (startYear >= 1920 & startYear <= 1979) |> 
  filter (runtimeMinutes >= 60 & runtimeMinutes <= 180) |>
  mutate(decade = case_when (
  startYear >= 1970 ~ "70s",
  startYear >= 1960 ~ "60s",
  startYear >= 1950 ~ "50s",
  startYear >= 1940 ~ "40s",
  startYear >= 1930 ~ "30s",
  startYear >= 1920 ~ "20s"
  ))
```

## Step 3 
Use {ggplot2} (part of {tidyverse}) to plot historgrams of the distribution of runtimeMinutes for each. I tried various binwidths from 5-50, and settled on 20.

```
{r}
g <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = runtimeMinutes))
g <- g + geom_histogram (na.rm = TRUE, binwidth= 20)
g <- g + facet_wrap(vars(decade))
g
```

## Step 4
Calculate population mean and standard deviation in runtimeMinutes for each decade and save the results in a new dataframe (results)

```
{r}
results <- d %>% group_by(decade) %>% 
  summarize (n = n(),
    mean= mean(runtimeMinutes),
    sd= sd(runtimeMinutes))
```

## Step 5 and Step 6
Sample 100 movies, without replacement, from each decade and calculate the single sample mean and single sample standard deviation in runtimeMinutes for each decade. Calculate for each decade the standard error around the estimate of the population mean runtimeMinutes based on the above sample

I wanted to maintain a copy of d that was not grouped, so I created a new dataframe, s, that is a copy of d. I also combined step six into step five just to keep the code neat!

```
{r}
s <- d
results_sampled <- s %>% 
  group_by(decade) %>% 
  slice_sample (n=100, replace = FALSE) %>%
  summarize (n = n(),
    mean= mean(runtimeMinutes),
    sd = sd(runtimeMinutes),
    se = sd/sqrt(n))
```

## Step 7
Compare the results from the actual population mean 

```
{r}
compare   
```
